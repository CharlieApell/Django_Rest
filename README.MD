# Foodie - API
Foodie is an exciting online community for food enthusiasts. It utilizes the Django Rest Framework walkthrough from Code Institute as the foundation for its backend API and database. This integration seamlessly supports the dynamic ReactJS frontend, providing a smooth and enjoyable user experience. Foodie enables users to share enticing food images, discover new flavors, and engage with like-minded individuals through features like comments, likes, and following fellow food enthusiasts.

## Database:

## Features

The Foodie API consists of five apps, each with its own unique models, views, URLs, and serializers.

A superuser can log in through the Django admin site to access the backend and administer the User model. Other users can access the API data through [https://drf-api-charlie.herokuapp.com/](https://drf-api-charlie.herokuapp.com/) and the corresponding URL for each API endpoint.

- [Profiles](https://drf-api-charlie.herokuapp.com/profiles/)
- [Posts](https://drf-api-charlie.herokuapp.com/posts/)
- [Likes](https://drf-api-charlie.herokuapp.com/likes/)
- [Comments](https://drf-api-charlie.herokuapp.com/comments/)
- [Followers](https://drf-api-charlie.herokuapp.com/followers/)

## Testing:
### Validator Testing: 
All Python files have been successfully passed through the PEP8 validator in gitpod with no issues, except for some long-line errors that have been adressed.

![PEP8](/assets/readme/pep8.png)

### Manual Testing:
- I manually verified that each URL path created works and opens without any errors.
- I confirmed the availability of CRUD functionality in each app using the development version. This includes features for comments, contact, followers, likes, posts, and profiles.
  - I checked this by visiting each link.
  - I created a new item.
  - I verified the URL path of the new item.
  - I tested editing the item (not applicable for likes, followers, or users).
  - I tested deleting the item (not applicable for users or profiles).
- I ensured that the search feature for the Posts, User, Location, and Price apps returns results.

### Unfixed Bugs
- None so far.

### Bugs
- I encountered a bug while trying to implement a rating feature in my code. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it to work properly, and it ended up affecting the commenting functionality as well. Due to time constraints, I had to revert the changes and go back to the old code for commenting. However, I plan to address the rating feature in the future and find a solution.

### Issues
**Issue** - When attempting to set "localhost" as the allowed host in the settings.py file, I encountered an issue where the application was not able to run properly. Instead, I had to manually paste the address generated by Gitpod as the allowed host.

**Issue** - I am currently experiencing an issue with the admin page in my Django project where the CSS file fails to load, resulting in an unstyled and visually unappealing interface. Due to time constraints, I am unable to address this problem at the moment.

## Deployment:

### Github & Gitpod

1. Create a repository on Github using this template [Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template), click "use this template" -> "Create a new repository.
2. Once the repository is created, click the green button on the right (Gitpod) to open a new Gitpod workspace.
3. To work on the project, it is recommended to open the workspace from Gitpod workspaces (instead of Github) to ensure continuity. Pin the workspace for easy access.
4. Make frequent commits with clear messages using the following commands:
   - `git add .`: adds all modified files to the staging area.
   - `git commit -m "A message explaining your commit"`: commits all changes to the local repository.
   - `git push`: pushes all committed changes to your Github repository.
5. During development, use the Gitpod development server to view the website by running the command `Python3 manage.py runserver`.

### Create a Django Rest Framework project

1. Install Django and supporting libraries such as Gunicorn, Cloudinary, psycopg2, Pillow, and Allauth.
2. In the terminal of the Gitpod workspace, type `django-admin startproject 'project_name'` to create the desired project name.
3. In the terminal of the Gitpod workspace, type `python3 manage.py startapp 'app_name'` to create the desired app name.
4. Create a `Requirements.txt` file (type `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`), an `env.py` file, and a `Procfile` at the top level of the project directory.
5. In `settings.py`, add the names of the installed apps to the `INSTALLED_APPS` array variable and save the file.
6. Move the `SECRET KEY` to the `env.py` file and add the `DATABASE URL`, `ALLOWED_HOST`, `DEV`, and `CLOUDINARY URL` as well.
7. Migrate changes by using the command `python3 manage.py migrate`.

### Elephant SQL

1. Log into ElephantSQL or create a new account.
2. Click to create a new instance and set up the plan by giving it a name (e.g., the tiny turtle plan).
3. Select the region (data center) closest to your location.
4. Click "Review," check that all the details are correct, and then click "Create Instance."
5. Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for the project.
6. Copy the ElephantSQL database URL that starts with `postgres://` using the copy icon.

### Heroku

1. Log into Heroku or create an account.
2. Click "New" to create a new Heroku app. Give the app a name and select your region (e.g., Europe).
3. Open the app settings tab and click "Reveal config vars."
4. Add a config var called `DATABASE_URL` and paste in the ElephantSQL database URL.
5. Add the config var `SECRET KEY` with the secret key from the Django `settings.py` file. It is recommended to create a new secret key for security purposes.
6. Add the config vars `CLOUDINARY_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, `ALLOWED_HOST`, `CLIENT_ORIGIN`, `CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV`, and `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`.
7. Under the project deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method. Search for the repository name and click "Connect." Scroll down to the manual deployment section and click "Deploy Branch." Make sure to select the main branch.
